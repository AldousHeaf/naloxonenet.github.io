            <h2 class="section-title">The Challenge</h2>
            <div class="pitch-content">
                <p class="lead-text">Over the past five years, an annual average of 3,238 adolescents have died due to unexpected overdoses. In two-thirds of these deaths, bystanders were present.</p>
                <p>The CDC has stated that reducing overdose fatalities requires increasing bystander access to naloxone and administration training. Anyone, in any place, could find themselves in the position of an overdose bystander, and <strong>NaloxoneNet empowers them to act</strong>.</p>
                <p>Currently, naloxone is administered by emergency responders in 96.6% of cases. Yet over half of victims have no pulse by the time these medics arrive. NaloxoneNet aims to significantly reduce this number through crowdsourcing, while also minimizing the stress and responsibility placed on initial responders.</p>

            <div class="market-content">
                <p>The greatest advantage of this innovation is its <strong>universal relevance</strong>. While NaloxoneNet is critical for individuals concerned about their own overdose safety, it also serves a broader audience by empowering users to intervene when they encounter someone else overdosing.</p>
                <p>Overdoses frequently occur in everyday settings—concerts, parties, dorm rooms, and private homes—often in the presence of bystanders. Our app functions as a safeguard, offering value with no downside to downloading it, even for users who do not anticipate regular use.</p>
                <h3>Initial Launch Markets</h3>
                <p>NaloxoneNet will initially launch in major college towns such as Ann Arbor, MI, Austin, TX, and Orlando, FL, with easy scalability to additional cities and states.</p>
                <h3>Competitive Advantage</h3>
                <p>Unlike state-run websites that are underdeveloped or limited by borders, NaloxoneNet provides both web and app access with more comprehensive data. Our AI support feature centralizes necessary information, eliminating inefficient text instructions and calming users during crisis situations. Unlike PulsePoint (AED locator), we require no community sponsorship or complex implementation process.</p>
